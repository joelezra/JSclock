# JSclock

JS30 day challenge Day 2

Made an analog clock that tells the time based on the computer's time using CSS and Javascript

Have an idea of making the hour hand move proportionally throughout the hour based on the current minutes to smooth transition instead of just ticking to the next hour, will look into that.
